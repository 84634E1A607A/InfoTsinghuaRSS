# Tsinghua Info scraper & RSS feeder

So this repo is for generating RSS feed from Tsinghua Info2021. Most of (at
least 95% of) the code is vibed and written by GLM 4.7 (With Claude Code).
GLM thinks he is Claude Sonnet, so when I ask him to write commit message,
he wrote Co-Authored-By claude. Laughs.

This scraper is deployed at https://inforss.aajax.top:3443/ and requires
Tsinghua Git OAuth login. Info feeds should be exclusive to THU students
and faculties. No public read.
